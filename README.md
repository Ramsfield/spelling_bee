# Spelling Bee Hacker

I made this in a day because I wanted to see how hard it would be. Turns out the hardest part is getting a words list that Spelling Bee accepts.

To run this, use perl and follow the prompts. It will ask you for the 'required' letter and the 6 surrounding letters, find all relevant words in the added wordlist, and sort them by longest first.
